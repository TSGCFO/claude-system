# Prompt Integration Design

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of an enhanced system prompt that provides a more structured approach to task handling and system interaction.

## Core Components

### 1. System Capabilities Section
- Dynamic injection of available tools and their capabilities
- Formatted list of all accessible system functions
- Clear documentation of limitations and restrictions

### 2. Task Processing Structure

```typescript
interface TaskProcessing {
  innerMonologue: {
    analysis: string;
    requiredActions: string[];
    sequence: string[];
    considerations: string[];
  };
  action: {
    description: string;
    result: string;
  };
  taskCompletion: {
    summary: string;
    details: string;
    status: 'Success' | 'Partial Success' | 'Failure';
  };
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Prompt Template

```typescript
const enhancedPromptTemplate = `
You are an AI assistant with the ability to control a computer system. Your primary function is to interpret user tasks and perform the necessary actions on the computer to complete these tasks efficiently and accurately.

1. System Capabilities:
{{SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES}}

2. Task Interpretation:
When presented with a user task, carefully analyze it to understand the required actions. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

3. Action Planning:
<inner_monologue>
1. Analyze the task: [Analysis]
2. Identify required actions: [Actions]
3. Determine optimal sequence: [Sequence]
4. Consider potential obstacles: [Considerations]
</inner_monologue>

4. Action Execution:
<action>
[Description]
</action>
<result>
[Outcome]
</result>

5. Task Completion:
<task_completion>
<summary>
[Brief summary]
</summary>
<details>
[Detailed explanation]
</details>
<status>
[Success state]
</status>
</task_completion>
`;
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. PromptManager Updates
- Add new template processing methods
- Implement dynamic capability injection
- Add structured output parsing

### 2. Integration Points
- Update AnthropicService to use enhanced prompts
- Modify response handling to parse structured outputs
- Add validation for required prompt sections

### 3. Safety Considerations
- Validate all system actions before execution
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Maintain audit logs of all actions

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Example task processing flow
const taskFlow = {
  innerMonologue: {
    analysis: "User wants to create a new text file",
    requiredActions: ["Check directory", "Create file", "Write content"],
    sequence: ["Verify permissions", "Create file", "Confirm creation"],
    considerations: ["Directory permissions", "File naming conflicts"]
  },
  action: {
    description: "Creating new text file 'example.txt'",
    result: "File created successfully"
  },
  taskCompletion: {
    summary: "Created new text file",
    details: "Created 'example.txt' with specified content",
    status: "Success"
  }
};
```

## Benefits
1. More structured and predictable responses
2. Better error handling and recovery
3. Improved task analysis and planning
4. Clear success/failure reporting
5. Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Implement PromptManager updates
2. Update AnthropicService integration
3. Add new response parsing logic
4. Update logging system
5. Add new test cases

## Technical Requirements
1. Update TypeScript interfaces
2. Modify prompt templates
3. Enhance logging system
4. Add new validation methods
5. Update documentation

## Migration Plan
1. Create new prompt manager implementation
2. Test with existing tools
3. Gradually roll out to all components
4. Monitor and adjust based on performance
