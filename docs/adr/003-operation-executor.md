# ADR 003: Operation Executor Design

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Claude System requires a robust Operation Executor component that can safely and reliably execute various system operations based on processed natural language commands. This component must handle different types of operations while maintaining system stability and security.

## Decision
Implement a modular Operation Executor with the following architecture:

1. Operation Manager
   - Operation queue management
   - Priority handling
   - Resource allocation
   - State management

2. Execution Modules
   - File System Operations
   - Web Navigation
   - Application Control
   - System Settings
   - Command Line Interface

3. Resource Controller
   - Resource allocation
   - Usage monitoring
   - Quota enforcement
   - Cleanup management

4. State Manager
   - System state tracking
   - Operation atomicity
   - Rollback management
   - State persistence

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. Operation Queue
   ```
   Incoming Operations → Priority Assignment → Resource Check → Execution Scheduling
   ```

2. Execution Pipeline
   ```
   Operation → Pre-checks → Resource Allocation → Execution → Post-checks → Cleanup
   ```

3. Module System
   ```
   Operation Type → Module Selection → Parameter Validation → Execution Strategy
   ```

### Operation Types

1. File System Operations
   - File creation/deletion
   - Directory management
   - Permission modifications
   - File transfers

2. Web Operations
   - Browser control
   - Navigation
   - Form interaction
   - Content extraction

3. Application Operations
   - Launch/terminate
   - Window management
   - Input simulation
   - State control

4. System Operations
   - Settings modification
   - Service management
   - Resource allocation
   - System monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Module Implementation
- Standardized module interface
- Clear operation contracts
- Resource requirements
- Error handling protocols

### State Management
- Atomic operations
- Transaction support
- Rollback capabilities
- State verification

### Resource Control
- Resource pools
- Usage tracking
- Quota enforcement
- Cleanup procedures

### Error Handling
- Operation timeouts
- Resource conflicts
- System constraints
- Recovery procedures

## Safety Measures

### Pre-execution Checks
- Resource availability
- Permission validation
- State consistency
- Impact assessment

### Runtime Monitoring
- Resource usage
- Operation progress
- System stability
- Error conditions

### Post-execution Validation
- Result verification
- State consistency
- Resource cleanup
- Audit logging

## Consequences

### Positive
