ant# ADR 004: Enhanced Prompt System Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to enhance our system's ability to handle complex tasks by implementing a more structured prompt system that provides better task analysis, execution planning, and result reporting. The current system lacks a standardized way to process tasks and report outcomes.

## Decision
We will implement an enhanced prompt system that includes:

1. Structured Task Processing
   - Inner monologue for task analysis and planning
   - Action execution with clear description and results
   - Standardized task completion reporting

2. System Capabilities Integration
   - Dynamic tool capability injection
   - Clear documentation of system limitations
   - Runtime capability validation

3. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Structured error reporting
   - Recovery strategies
   - Audit logging

## Architecture Components

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Manager
```

│   ├── System Capabilities Injection
│   ├── Task Structure Templates
│   └── Response Format Templates
├── Validation
│   ├── Capability Validation
│   ├── Action Validation
│   └── Response Structure Validation
└── Output Processing
    ├── Response Parsing
    ├── Status Tracking
    └── Error Handling

```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Prompt Structure
```typescript
interface EnhancedPrompt {
  systemCapabilities: {
    tools: ToolMetadata[];
    limitations: string[];
  };
  taskProcessing: {
    analysis: string;
    planning: ActionPlan;
    execution: ActionExecution[];
  };
  outputFormat: {
    summary: string;
    details: string;
    status: TaskStatus;
  };
}
```

### 2. Response Processing
```typescript
interface StructuredResponse {
  innerMonologue: {
    analysis: string;
    actions: string[];
    sequence: string[];
    considerations: string[];
  };
  execution: {
    action: string;
    result: string;
  }[];
  completion: {
    summary: string;
    details: string;
    status: 'Success' | 'Partial' | 'Failure';
  };
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
1. More predictable and structured task handling
2. Better error recovery and reporting
3. Improved task analysis and planning
4. Enhanced debugging capabilities
5. Better system capability documentation
6. More consistent user experience

### Negative
1. Increased system complexity
2. Higher processing overhead
3. More complex prompt management
4. Additional validation requirements

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Update PromptManager with new template system
2. Implement capability injection
3. Add structured response parsing

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Update AnthropicService
2. Enhance Tool Registry
3. Update Learning System

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing
1. Add comprehensive validation
2. Implement error handling
3. Add new test cases

## Validation

Success criteria for this architecture:
1. Successful task completion rate improvement
2. Reduced error rates
3. Better error recovery
4. More consistent output format
5. Improved debugging capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Simple Prompt Extension
- Pros: Simpler implementation
- Cons: Less structured, harder to validate

### 2. External Task Processor
- Pros: More flexible, separate concerns
- Cons: Additional complexity, more points of failure

### 3. Rule-Based System
- Pros: More predictable
- Cons: Less flexible, harder to maintain
