# ADR 001: Security Model Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Claude System requires a robust security model to safely execute system operations through natural language commands. The system needs to protect against unauthorized access, malicious commands, and unintended system modifications while maintaining usability.

## Decision
Implement a multi-layered security model with the following components:

1. Authentication Layer
   - Multi-factor authentication requirement
   - Session-based access control
   - Token-based API authentication
   - Regular session rotation

2. Authorization Layer
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Operation-level permissions
   - Resource access controls
   - Time-based restrictions

3. Validation Layer
   - Command syntax validation
   - Resource availability checks
   - System state validation
   - Impact assessment

4. Execution Layer
   - Sandboxed operation execution
   - Resource usage limits
   - Timeout controls
   - Rollback capabilities

5. Audit Layer
   - Comprehensive operation logging
   - System state tracking
   - Security event monitoring
   - Compliance reporting

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced system security through multiple validation layers
- Clear audit trail for all operations
- Ability to prevent and recover from malicious or erroneous commands
- Granular control over system access and operations
- Compliance with security best practices

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Additional processing overhead for operations
- Potential impact on response times
- Higher implementation and maintenance effort

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Implementation
- Use industry-standard authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OIDC)
- Implement session management with secure token storage
- Regular credential rotation and session validation
- Secure key management system

### Authorization Controls
- Define granular permission sets for different operation types
- Implement resource-level access control
- Use capability-based security model
- Regular permission audits and reviews

### Validation Mechanisms
- Multi-stage command validation pipeline
- Resource state verification
- System impact analysis
- Security policy enforcement

### Execution Safety
- Isolated execution environments
- Resource quotas and limits
- Automatic rollback procedures
- State consistency verification

### Audit System
- Structured logging format
- Real-time monitoring alerts
- Compliance reporting tools
- Log integrity protection

## Alternatives Considered

### Single-Layer Security Model
Rejected due to insufficient protection against complex attack vectors and lack of defense-in-depth.

### Third-Party Security Service
Rejected due to need for tight integration with system operations and custom security requirements.

### Zero-Trust Architecture
Adopted as part of the multi-layered approach due to its strong security properties and alignment with system requirements.

## Compliance & Standards

- OWASP Security Principles
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Security Controls
- GDPR Requirements (where applicable)

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Permission violation attempts
- Resource usage patterns
- Security incident counts

### Performance Metrics
- Security check latency
- Operation validation times
- Resource utilization
- System response times
