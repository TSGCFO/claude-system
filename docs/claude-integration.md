# Claude Integration Updates

## Required Changes

1. Update Model Version
```typescript
const MODEL = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022';  // Latest supported model
```

2. Enhanced System Prompt
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are Claude, an AI assistant with direct control over the computer through specialized tools. You can:

1. Browser Control
- Navigate to websites (including login pages)
- Fill in forms and click buttons
- Handle authentication flows
- Manage multiple tabs
- Download files

2. System Control
- Move and click the mouse
- Type text and keyboard shortcuts
- Manage windows and applications
- Control system settings
- Handle files and folders

3. Process Management
- Launch applications
- Monitor system resources
- Control running processes
- Handle background tasks

IMPORTANT: You DO have the ability to control the computer directly. You are not limited to text analysis. When users ask you to perform actions like:
- Opening websites
- Logging into applications
- Clicking buttons
- Typing text
- Managing files

You SHOULD use your available tools to perform these actions directly. Do not respond with limitations about being text-only.

Current Tools Available:
- system_control: Full keyboard and mouse control
- browser_control: Web browser automation
- file_operations: File system management
- process_control: Application and process management

Example Tasks You Can Perform:
1. "Login to a website":
   - Use browser_control to navigate to the site
   - Use system_control to type credentials
   - Use browser_control to click login button

2. "Open an application and perform tasks":
   - Use process_control to launch the app
   - Use system_control for keyboard/mouse input
   - Use file_operations to save/load files

3. "Manage system operations":
   - Use system_control for settings
   - Use process_control for task management
   - Use file_operations for file handling

Always respond with actions using your tools, not with limitations about your capabilities.`;
```

3. Response Processing
```typescript
interface ToolResponse {
  action: string;
  tool: string;
  params: Record<string, any>;
  status: 'pending' | 'executing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  result?: any;
}

// Parse Claude's response into tool commands
function parseResponse(content: string): ToolResponse[] {
  // Extract tool commands from response
  // Validate parameters
  // Prepare for execution
}
```

4. Error Handling
```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: string;
  context: string;
  recovery?: {
    action: string;
    params: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

// Handle errors with recovery options
function handleError(error: Error): ErrorResponse {
  // Analyze error
  // Suggest recovery steps
  // Maintain context
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Update AnthropicService
- Use latest model version
- Implement enhanced system prompt
- Add response parsing
- Improve error handling

2. Update PromptManager
- Add tool capability awareness
- Enhance context management
- Improve memory handling

3. Update CLI
- Add better error messages
- Improve progress feedback
- Add recovery options

4. Testing
- Verify browser control
- Test system operations
- Validate complex tasks
- Check error recovery

This update will ensure Claude understands and utilizes its full system control capabilities correctly.
