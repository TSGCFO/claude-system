# System Improvements

## 1. API Integration Fix
We need to update the AnthropicService to use the correct API and model:
- Change model to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (or `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`)
- Use the Messages API with the latest SDK version 0.10.2

## 2. Web Interface Implementation
To improve the user experience, we should create a web interface with:

### Frontend Features
- Modern, responsive design using React
- Real-time chat interface with message history
- Tool execution status and results display
- System information dashboard
- File browser component
- Browser control interface
- Dark/light theme support

### Backend Updates
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Session management
- Result streaming
- File upload/download capabilities

### Components
1. Chat Interface
   - Message history
   - Tool execution status
   - Response formatting
   - Code highlighting

2. System Dashboard
   - CPU/Memory usage
   - Active processes
   - Recent operations
   - Logs viewer

3. File Manager
   - Directory browser
   - File preview
   - Search interface
   - Drag and drop support

4. Browser Control
   - URL input
   - Navigation controls
   - Screenshot preview
   - Element inspector

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up React project with TypeScript
2. Add WebSocket support to server
3. Create base UI components
4. Implement real-time updates
5. Add file management interface
6. Create system monitoring dashboard
7. Add browser control interface
8. Implement dark/light theme
9. Add error handling and notifications
10. Add session management

This will provide a much better user experience than the current CLI interface, making it easier to:
- View operation history
- Monitor system status
- Manage files visually
- Control browser actions
- See results in real-time

## 3. Model Configuration
Using `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (or `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`) for:
- Excellent performance and reliability
- Great balance of speed and capability
- Cost-effective for most operations
- Suitable for both simple and complex tasks
